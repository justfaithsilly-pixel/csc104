                <h2>About the channel</h2>
                <p>JustFaithSilly has been around for over 10 years since 2013</p>
                <p>I used to start my channel with clay videos, which are now privated</p>
                <p>My channel is now filled with animations based on favorite shows and video games</p>
                <p>My channel has over 100 videos, while a few videos have a million views</p>

                Ever since 2013, My YouTube Channel was born. Several years later, animations started to grow on my channel since 2018. And finally, my website is here for everyone! You can check out information about me as the creator, my characters, and my YouTube history in making fan-made videos for all to enjoy.

            <h2>The Origin of the Channel</h2>

            <p>
                JustFaithSilly used to have videos of clay videos back in 2013. I decided to private them because I think they weren't a good fit to the channel and I think they aren't funny anymore. The channel went on hiatus for 5 years with no other videos posted with an exception of 2017, which has one video. In 2018, the channel made a comeback, surprising viewers with fan-made animations that spike up with love, care and has a lot of views and fans.

            <ul>
                <li>2007 - My dad wanted me to say my name, and I said, "It's just Faith, silly". That sentence is the origin of where JustFaithSilly came from.</li>
                <li>2013 - My YouTube was created in June 28, 2013. The first video was uploaded the day after. After a few videos were uploaded, the channel went on hiatus for a long time.</li>
                <li>2017 - In November, the YouTube channel decided to post one more video before possibly going on another hiatus or planning for another new level for the channel</li>
                <li>2018 - Starting from June, the YouTube channel made a surprise return by posting episodes of a fan-made series based on her favorite shows and video games. Those videos started off slow for a return, but began to grow to be an amazing comeback for the fans.</li>
                <li>2019 - I started an Instagram channel based on my YouTube Channel. I posted artwork and screenshots from my videos.</li>
                <li>2020 - The YouTube channel gained 10,000 subscribers in March during the COVID pandemic.</li>
                <li>2022 - My Twitter/X account is created. I mostly use it for liking posts and commenting, while I slightly post on Twitter, but not that much.</li>
                <li>2023 - My TikTok account is created. It hasn't been active since because I've been thinking of my first video to post</li>
